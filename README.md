POC: Clinton Stipek - stipekcw@ornl.gov

- To see current workflow please see workflow.PNG

## Getting started

The main objective:

1. To develop a model (Vivaldi) that generates building height from building morphology features 
    - Current state of art is using 162 features (city, block, street level information)
    - Vivaldi is using 30 features from Gauntlet (morphology features derived from footprint information - 65 features)
        - Gauntlet POC: Taylor Hauser - hausertr@ornl.gov
    - Metrics for comparison are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), and Goodness of Fit (R^2)
    - There are 4 different test (3 LiDAR, 1 Satellite)
      a. 
    - Compared against current state of the art (LiDAR) and Microsoft (Satellite)
